All the file is below:

- app.py:
This file is likely a Python script, and its purpose would depend on its code and functionality. In web development, app.py is often used as the main application script, especially in frameworks like Flask or Django. It might contain the server logic, routing, and other aspects of a web application.


- READEME.md:
This is typically a Markdown file used to provide documentation and information about a project. It's often used to describe how to use the project, its purpose, installation instructions, and other important details. README files are commonly found in software repositories to help users and developers understand the project.


- data.db:
This file is commonly used as a database file, where data is stored. The exact format and content would depend on the specific application using it. It could be an SQLite database, a data store, or a similar data file used by the application.


- The static folder has one file is called main.css. 
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to define the visual style and layout of web pages. main.css is a common naming convention for the primary or main CSS file of a website. It contains the styling rules, such as fonts, colors, margins, and other visual properties, that are applied to the HTML elements. CSS is used to make the webpage visually appealing and user-friendly.


- The templates folder has 3 files:
1, base.html:
This is often a template or layout file used in web development. It contains the common structure and elements that are shared across multiple pages of a website. Elements like the header, footer, navigation menu, and other consistent components are defined here. Other HTML files, like index.html, can inherit from base.html to maintain a consistent look and structure throughout the website. It reduces redundancy in code and makes it easier to maintain a cohesive design.

2, index.html:
This is usually the main content file for a specific webpage. It's the HTML file that represents the content and structure of the webpage that visitors see. index.html would typically extend or include base.html to inherit the common layout elements and then add or modify content specific to the page. It's often the entry point or landing page for a website.
